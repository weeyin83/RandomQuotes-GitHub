# Random Quotes
Fun random quotes web app.  App is built using Microsoft's ASP.NET core framework and it's very simple.

This is a copy of the [Octopus Deploy RandomQuotes application](https://github.com/OctopusSamples/RandomQuotes), some modifications have been made to the code to upgrade to .NET 6. 

This code is used by [Sarah Lean](https://www.twitter.com/techielass) for demos. 

Within this repository you will find:
